            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the glaze:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>For the dough:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, stir together the warm milk, granulated sugar, and yeast. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining ingredients. Begin mixing on low speed until the mixture starts to come together. Increase the speed to medium-low and continue kneading until the dough is springy and tacky to the touch but doesn’t stick to your fingers, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled large bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place (about 75F) until doubled in size, about 1½ to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a 9×13-inch baking pan with butter or baking spray</li>
            <li>Turn out the dough onto a well-floured surface. Roll the dough into roughly a 12×24-inch rectangle.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the filling:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread the butter onto the dough in a thin and even layer, leaving a ½-inch border down one long side of the dough. (make sure your butter is very soft! If it’s still firm, microwave it in 5-second increments until easily spreadable.)</li>
            <li>n a small bowl, stir together the sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar all over the butter.</li>
            <li>Starting at one long end opposite the unbuttered border, roll up the dough into a tight log. Cut the log into 12 equal pieces (about 2 inches wide) using a sharp serrated knife or unflavored dental floss.</li>
            <li>Place the rolls cut side down evenly spaced in the prepared baking dish. Loosely cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F while rising.</li>
            <li>Uncover and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned on top. Place on a wire rack to cool.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the glaze:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>While the rolls are baking, combine the cream cheese, butter, vanilla and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Beat together on medium speed until smooth. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat on low speed until well combined. For a thinner consistency, beat in 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk.</li>
            <li>When the rolls are right out of the oven, spread a third of the glaze over the hot rolls. Let cool for 5 minutes, then spread the remaining glaze on top. The rolls are best enjoyed warm but can be covered and stored at room temperature for 2 days.</li>
        </ol>
